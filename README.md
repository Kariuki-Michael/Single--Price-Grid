## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was another opportunity to learn more about CSS grids and also got to practice responsive web design. I am finally getting the concepts I had trouble with earlier and it's quite a wonderful journey.

### Continued development

I want to perfect my CSS skills and continue building more projects.
I want to start learning JavaScript to continue with my journey of becoming a full stack developer.
